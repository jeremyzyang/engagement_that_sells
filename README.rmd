1.  List of code

The code contains 11 scripts in Python or R divided into construction
(scripts 1-5), evaluation (scripts 6-7), and interpretation (scripts
8-11) of the algorithm. Each script is named after the task it performs.
The main results reported in the paper and online appendices can be
reproduced from scripts 6, 7, and 11.
